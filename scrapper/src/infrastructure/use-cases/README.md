## Note on the `get-source-(A|B)-results` use cases

The `get-source-a-results.use-case.ts` and `get-source-b-results.use-case.ts` files are examples of how to implement page scraping to obtain lottery results.

It is important to note that these use cases **do not scrape any real web page**. Instead, they operate on a fictional HTML page structure that serves as a template or model to demonstrate the data extraction process.
